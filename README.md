# React Dad-Joke app
## Experiments with React

This application loads dad-jokes from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/. Jokes are displayed in a scrollable list and can be up/down voted to give them an overall rating. The joke list reorders itself based on joke rating.

There is a button to get more jokes form the API and add them to the list. Jokes are stored locally in localStorage.
